# Portfolio Website of Sai Chamarty

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It has 4 pages: Home, Projects, Saiborg and About

### run `npm start` to run the app in localhost dev mode.

## This website's specialities:
### Home page animaton
Home page has a really cool introduction about me, Sai Chamarty and what I like. Even though it is a regular text, I have used CSS animations to create a cool come through of letters.

### Saiborg Animation/effect
Saiborg is a conversational AI robot being built. The animation used in the website has been created by me in blender and displayed on the page using three.js.

### Deployment
This website is live at:
[https://sai.junebase.com]

Junebase is my server that I built using an old lenovo laptop.  
Junebase acts like vercel deployment and github actions make it possible for auto-updating the website deployed when main branch of this repo is updated.   
Pretty cool right?
